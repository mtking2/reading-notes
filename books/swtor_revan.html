        <div class="chapsums"><h2>Prologue</h2>
<h6>(Revan)</h6>
<p>...</p>
<h2>Chapters 1 &amp; 2</h2>
<h6>(Scourge)</h6>
<p>In classic Sith fashion, Darth Nyriss puts Lord Scourge to the test as he arrives back on Dromund Kaas, after two years aways following his graduation from the Sith academy, to aid her in uncovering the people behind a recent string of assassination attempts on her life. Now, returning as a fully-fledged Sith Lord, Scourge quickly realizes that he must subdue his own arrogance if he is to win the trust of Darth Nyriss.</p>
<h2>Chapter 3</h2>
<h6>(Revan)</h6>
<p>On Coruscant, Revan &amp; T3-M4 visit the Galactic Market to meet up with an old ally, Canderous Ordo, a Mando who helped Revan take down Darth Malak. Now, having nightmares of a lightning covered planet and wanting answers to his forgotten memories as a Sith Lord, Revan calls on Canderous to help him regroup the Mando clans by finding the lost mask of Mandalore so they can join the Republic to face this impending threat.</p>
<h2>Chapter 4</h2>
<h6>(Scourge)</h6>
<p>Scourge and Sechel, advisor to Darth Nyriss, arrive at Hallion on a mission to break into the UDM plant in order to uncover the origins of a modified UDM assassin droid used against Nyriss. With Sechel unable to slice into the records office, Scourge bypasses it with a lightsaber but trips the alarm. By dispatching waves of assault droids and killing power to the plant they manage to escape with the records.</p>
<h2>Chapter 5</h2>
<h6>(Revan)</h6>
<p>Revan visits the Jedi Temple to see if the Archives might have info on Meetra Surik, a general under him during the MW. Meetra had activated a mass-shadow generator at Malachor V, decimating the planet and a majority of the Mando fleet with it, effectively ending the war but disappearing shortly after. Confronted by Jedi Atris, Revan (re)learns Meetra permanently cut herself off from the force and is still missing.</p>
<h2>Chapter 6</h2>
<h6>(Scourge)</h6>
<p>A week after his last mission, a fully healed Scourge meets with Nyriss about his next steps. Sechel has traced the location of the assassin droid back to the planet Bosthirda. Skeptical of Sechel, Scourge is ordered to visit this planet with Sechel and Murtog (security capt.) and investigate further. But not before Nyriss gives him a Sith lesson about channeling his emotions inward when facing a non-organic enemy.</p>
<h2>Chapter 7</h2>
<h6>(Revan)</h6>
<p>Revan and T3 meet back up with Cancerous Ordo. The Mando as news that the Clans are on the Rekkiad looking for the Mask of Mandalore. They plan to be there when it's found. Revan returns to Bastille with news of their new mission but Bastila has some news of her own. She is pregnant. They argue about not doing the mission but Revan convinces her otherwise and they agree she should stay behind. Revan, T3, and Cancerous board the Ebon Hawk and leave for Rekkiad.</p>
<h2>Chapter 8</h2>
<h6>(Scourge)</h6>
<p>Scourge, Sechel, Mertog, and Co. storm the separatist base on Bosthirda. Before the seps were able to delete their files Sechel uncovers a partial holorecording seeming to implicate Darth Xedrix in the assassination plot.</p>
<p>The three reconvene with Nyriss back on Dromund Kaas and discuss this unsettling information. It confirms some suspicions Nyriss has had about Xedrix. They plan to assassinate Xedrix just as he has tried to do with Nyriss. Sechel is to send a fake separatist message to set up a meeting (ambush) with Xedrix. Scourge hopes, if the plan is successful, he can use this to his advantage to lay a path to his own seat on the Dark Council.</p>
<h2>Chapter 9</h2>
<h6>(Revan)</h6>
<p>Arriving on Rekkiad, Revan, Canderous, and T3 have a rough time even locating the Ordo Clan camp - let alone trying to fly and landing the Ebon Hawk on the ice planet during a snowstorm. With damaged landing gear they manage to make a rough landing 5km outside the camp. Donning all the winter gear they have they make out for the camp, leaving T3 to man and repair the ship.</p>
<p>They approach the camp and among the tents and shacks, Revan happen to notice four large tarp cover mounds. Even though covered, he immediately recognized these as Basilisk War Droids - extremely powerful and lethal mechanical mounts the Mandos used during the MW. Revan had ordered them all to be destroyed at the end of the war but clearly not all of the clans listened.</p>
<p>During their scouting, a voice calls out from behind. Four Mando sentries with blasters holding them gun point. Canderous immediately recognizes the voice and reveals himself to the sentries. Blasters are lowered and they exchange excited Mando greetings. They are brought to the central shack and more greetings are exchanged in Mando'a before a large and broad figure enters. Silence falls and this figure, removing layers to reveal Mando woman, and Canderous exchange a bitter greeting. Veela, she greats Canderous, they talk of finding the Mask of Mandalore, and she addresses the outsider (Revan). Canderous introduces him as Avren (anagram of Revan). Veela welcomes him into the clan so long as he doesn't disrupt, betray, or slow them down; they exchange some witty/snarky remarks in Mando'a, amusing the rest of the clan. As she exits, Canderous explains Veela is his wife.</p>
