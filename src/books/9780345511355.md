## Prologue
###### (Revan)

...

## Chapters 1 & 2
###### (Scourge)

In classic Sith fashion, Darth Nyriss puts Lord Scourge to the test as he arrives back on Dromund Kaas, after two years aways following his graduation from the Sith academy, to aid her in uncovering the people behind a recent string of assassination attempts on her life. Now, returning as a fully-fledged Sith Lord, Scourge quickly realizes that he must subdue his own arrogance if he is to win the trust of Darth Nyriss.

## Chapter 3
###### (Revan)

On Coruscant, Revan & T3-M4 visit the Galactic Market to meet up with an old ally, Canderous Ordo, a Mando who helped Revan take down Darth Malak. Now, having nightmares of a lightning covered planet and wanting answers to his forgotten memories as a Sith Lord, Revan calls on Canderous to help him regroup the Mando clans by finding the lost mask of Mandalore so they can join the Republic to face this impending threat.

## Chapter 4
###### (Scourge)

Scourge and Sechel, advisor to Darth Nyriss, arrive at Hallion on a mission to break into the UDM plant in order to uncover the origins of a modified UDM assassin droid used against Nyriss. With Sechel unable to slice into the records office, Scourge bypasses it with a lightsaber but trips the alarm. By dispatching waves of assault droids and killing power to the plant they manage to escape with the records.

## Chapter 5
###### (Revan)

Revan visits the Jedi Temple to see if the Archives might have info on Meetra Surik, a general under him during the MW. Meetra had activated a mass-shadow generator at Malachor V, decimating the planet and a majority of the Mando fleet with it, effectively ending the war but disappearing shortly after. Confronted by Jedi Atris, Revan (re)learns Meetra permanently cut herself off from the force and is still missing.

## Chapter 6
###### (Scourge)

A week after his last mission, a fully healed Scourge meets with Nyriss about his next steps. Sechel has traced the location of the assassin droid back to the planet Bosthirda. Skeptical of Sechel, Scourge is ordered to visit this planet with Sechel and Murtog (security capt.) and investigate further. But not before Nyriss gives him a Sith lesson about channeling his emotions inward when facing a non-organic enemy.

## Chapter 7
###### (Revan)

Revan and T3 meet back up with Cancerous Ordo. The Mando as news that the Clans are on the planet Rekkiad looking for the Mask of Mandalore. They plan to be there when it's found. Revan returns to Bastille with news of their new mission but Bastila has some news of her own. She is pregnant. They argue about not doing the mission but Revan convinces her otherwise and they agree she should stay behind. Revan, T3, and Cancerous board the Ebon Hawk and leave for Rekkiad.

## Chapter 8
###### (Scourge)

Scourge, Sechel, Mertog, and Co. storm the separatist base on Bosthirda. Before the seps were able to delete their files Sechel uncovers a partial holo-recording seeming to implicate Darth Xedrix in the assassination plot.

The three reconvene with Nyriss back on Dromund Kaas and discuss this unsettling information. It confirms some suspicions Nyriss has had about Xedrix. They plan to assassinate Xedrix just as he has tried to do with Nyriss. Sechel is to send a fake separatist message to set up a meeting (ambush) with Xedrix. Scourge hopes, if the plan is successful, he can use this to his advantage to lay a path to his own seat on the Dark Council.

## Chapter 9
###### (Revan)

Arriving on Rekkiad, Revan, Canderous, and T3 have a rough time even locating the Ordo Clan camp - let alone trying to fly and landing the Ebon Hawk on the ice planet during a snowstorm. With damaged landing gear they manage to make a rough landing 5km outside the camp. Donning all the winter gear they have they make out for the camp, leaving T3 to man and repair the ship.

They approach the camp and, among the tents and shacks, Revan happens to notice four large tarp cover mounds. Even though covered, he immediately recognized these as Basilisk War Droids - extremely powerful and lethal mechanical mounts the Mandos used during the MW. Revan had ordered them all to be destroyed at the end of the war but clearly not all of the clans listened.

During their scouting, a voice calls out from behind. Four Mando sentries with blasters hold them at gun point. Canderous immediately recognizes the voice and reveals himself to the sentries. Blasters are lowered and they exchange Mando greetings. They are brought to the central shack and more greetings are exchanged in Mando'a before a large and broad figure enters. Silence falls and this figure, removing layers to reveal Mando woman, and Canderous exchange a bitter greeting. Veela, she greats Canderous, they talk of finding the Mask of Mandalore, and she addresses the outsider (Revan). Canderous introduces him as Avren (anagram of Revan). Veela welcomes him into the clan so long as he doesn't disrupt, betray, or slow them down; they exchange some witty/snarky remarks in Mando'a, amusing the rest of the clan. As she exits, Canderous explains Veela is his wife.

## Chapter 10
###### (Scourge)

Scourge waits in a cave on Bosthirda for a meeting with Darth Xedrix that Sechel was able to set up. Scourge, donning a Sith cloak and hiding in the rocks and shadows, hears a speeder arrive. Xedrix and two accompanying Sith acolytes - humans, one male one female, enter the cave. Scourge leaps from the shadows, igniting his lightsaber, towards Xedrix who was trailing behind. In the split second before Scourge lands his blow, Xedrix quickly ignites his saber and blocks the attack. The two acolytes rush in as Xedrix falls back. An intense lightsaber battle ensues between the three. During the fighting Scourge reaches out with the Force and is able to discern that the female is the stronger of the two and that they both have attachments for each other. Scourge uses this to his advantage by focusing attacks on the weaker male knowing that the female will attempt to save him and block any would-be fatal blows. Scourge leaps at the male and she attempts to block. In mid air he redirects his attack towards the female and manages to knock them both down. Scourge crushes the female's head with his foot and quickly turns to knock back the male with a force push. Before he is able get back to his feet, Scourge force throws his lightsaber to the male acolyte - decapitating him.

With the acolytes out of the way Scourge then approaches Darth Xedrix. Scourge cannot sense any emotion coming from Xedrix whatsoever -  he is producing a shield of dark side energy. Xedrix attempts to persuade Scourge that Nyriss is the real enemy. Scourge dismisses it and then Xedrix releases a burst of force lightning onto him frying him near to death. Xedrix tries to further convince Scourge that Nyriss is using and manipulating him and he urges Scourge to join him. Scourge is able resist and see past the dark side persuasion, but then realizes that the veil of dark side energy surrounding Xedrix as fallen. Scourge is able to sense that Xedrix is fearful and drained of all his energy and confirming Nyriss' belief that Xedrix has become too old and weak to sustain his power. He approaches Xedrix knowing that he can no longer fight back but he tries to give one final plea to Scourge. Without hesitation Scourge delivers a fatal slash across his chest and removes his head to bring as proof of his demise back to Nyriss.

## Chapter 11
###### (Revan)

Revan awakens from a dream - <i>or rather a memory</i> - about him and Malak atop one of two large pillars of ice towering above a snow covered planet, the same planet of Rekkiad he is now on. Revan remembers this as the place he hid the Mask of Mandalore. Hungover from a night of celebrating with Canderous and his clan mates for their reunion, Revan contacts T3 with his holocomm and T3 is eager to report the ship has been repaired albeit still partially buried in snow. Revan asks T3 to do a surface scan of the area for any rock/ice formations matching the description of those from Revan's recalled memory and quicky finds a match. With the coordinates in hand, Revan wakes Canderous with this new information. The two hold a meeting in the supply shack with Veela and the rest of the clan and they are able to convince her and the clan to move camp 50km to these two pillars, which are known to the clan as the _Twin Spears_, even though another Mandalorian clan, Jendri, has claimed them under their territory.

The next morning, with military like efficiency, the clan pack-up camp and made out for the _Twin Spears_. Marching two by two with a forward scouting group, and using the Basilisk War Droids to tow supply crates, it takes them the whole day to travel â…”-rds  of the way there. They setup camp for the night in a nearby valley. The next morning they head-on to the _Twin Spears_, moving extra cautiously since they are now deep into Clan Jendri territory. Finally reaching the ice pillars they setup camp once more near the base of the _Spears_.

During the early hours of the next morning Clan Jendri began their attack on the Ordo camp. Feeling the disturbance through the force, Revan woke before the alarm sounded. Canderous was already out in the midst of battle. Revan bolted out of the tent with twin blasters in hand. Amongst the chaos he saw that 4 of Clan Jendri's Basilisk War Droids were in flight laying waste down onto the battlefield but all 6 of Clan Ordo's war droids were still grounded. He shoots his way over to the droids and finds that Canderous, Veela, and the rest of the Basilisk pilots were stuck taking cover behind some snowy rocks from the other 4 Jendri droids. In a split decision to forgo his concealed identity, Revan leaps from behind the rocks and ignites his green lightsaber. Dodging and weaving, he's able to flank one of the Basilisks and jump on it's back - taking out the pilot with a lightsaber through the chest. Revan's distraction allowed the others to mount their Basilisks and take to the air. Now outgunning the Jendri they are easily able to take the battlefieldand push them back, making them retreat.

With the battle won, the <em>Twin Spears</em> are now rightfully in Clan Ordo's territory. Veela acknowledges Revan/Avren as a Jedi (<i>although unsure if she yet knows his true identity</i>) and orders him to help with the wounded and to make preparations to scale the first of the two <em>Spears</em> the next morning.


## Chapter 12
###### (Scourge)

Scourge returns back to Dromund Kaas in the the dark of night without alerting Nyriss or anyone of his arrival. He sneaks into Sechel's quarters, awakening him at knife point and proceeds to interrogate him. Sechel hesitates on a few questions and Scrouge severs a couple of tendrils on his cheeks to get answers out of him. Sechel reveals that Nyriss has been using him, but not entirely in the way that Darth Xedrix had implied, and that, even though Xedrix really had been colluding with the separatists, he was <em><b>not</b></em> behind the assassination attempts on Nyriss.

Nyriss enters and interrupts the interrogation - commanding that Scourge follows her back to her quarters for a private conversation. Nyriss reveals to Scourge that she orchestrated the assassination attempts on herself as a means to put the blame on Darth Xedrix and further justify his killing. She also reveals that she is apart of a secret inner circle within the Dark Council whose goal is to bring down the Emperor. She explains that Xedrix had been apart of this inner circle but was being to reckless and was putting the circle and their plot at risk of being discovered by the Emperor.

She continues on stating that the Emperor has lived for thousands of years and has found an unorthodox & horrific way to cheat death that involves his hidden home planet of Nathema. Not only that, but he is planning to launch a full-scale war against the Republic & the Jedi Order out of anger and retaliation for the events that took place during the Great Hyperspace War. A war where the Republic & the Jedi Order very nearly eradicated the Sith Empire (<i>then led by the Sith Lord Naga Sadow</i>). So Nyriss and the rest of the circle have decided that the Emperor must be stopped, otherwise he will start another great war, one that her and the circle know that the Sith Empire cannot win.

After the long revelation, Nyriss essentially invites Scourge into this secret circle but informs him that they will be visiting the Emperors home world of Nathema so Scourge can witness the atrocities of the Emperor for himself.

## Chapter 13
###### (Revan)

<div markdown class="latest">
  <a name="latest"></a>

  That night after the battle, Clan Ordo had a funeral pyre for the dead (both Ordo and Jendri alike) and then celebrated long into the night for their victory. Revan sits back, moderating his ale intake, and watches the room. Veela and the other 5 Basilisk pilots cautiously keep an eye on Revan - now knowing that he is a Jedi. Revan's intuition tells him that Veela and the pilots still are most likely unaware of his true identity and will at least keep the knowledge of him being a Jedi from the rest of the clan for now. Edric, cousin and best clan-mate to Canderous<sup><a href="#fn1" class="fn-num">1</a></sup>, approaches Revan and gives him praise for his efforts in the battle. After the celebrations Revan and Canderous return to their tent for the night.

  In the morning, they begin preparing to summit the first of the <em>Twin Spears</em>. They were hoping for clearer weather but the wind and snow are relentless. Veela, the 5 others Basilisk pilots, Canderous, and Revan gear up and make their way to the base of pillar while Edric stays behind and leads the camp.

  The began their slow and steady summit in 2 squads of 4, each with a tether connecting them all together. Placing one anchor after another and shifting the tether up at each one, they climb.
